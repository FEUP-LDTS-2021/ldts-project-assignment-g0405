# LDTS_04_05 - Cross the Map

[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/FEUP-LDTS-2021/ldts-project-assignment-g0405?branch=main&token=e13264603f79bc7b3a224eb89e8f866e44f94999)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

Our game consists in a text-based version of the Crossy Road game with some SuperMario combinations and some new characters.

For the player to finish each level with the highest score, it needs to catch all the biscuits and the special key to open the prison door where the Princess is being kept.

The main character is Jack the Sparrow who is trying to free his Princess, and for that he needs to avoid the Pirates and collect the special key.

Each biscuit that Jack catches makes his score go up, but these are not necessary to release the Princess.
