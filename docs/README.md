# LDTS_04_05 - Cross the Map

Our game consists in a text-based version of the Crossy Road game with some SuperMario combinations and some new characters.

The main character is Jack the Sparrow who is trying to free his Princess, and for that he needs to avoid the Pirates and all explosions from the bombs and collect the special key.

For the player to win the game with the highest score, it needs to catch all the biscuits, which represents the score, and the special key to open the prison door where the Princess is being kept.

After rescuing the Princess is opened and Jack needs to leave the map through that door.

Each biscuit that Jack catches makes his score go up, but these are not necessary to release the Princess and finish the game.

## Planned Features

- **Different Pirates** - We will make three kinds of Pirates, each one with different speeds and the bigger one will leave bombs behind.
- **Menu** - There will be a menu when you open the game with some buttons.
- **Personalized Font** - We'll create a new font to have our characters and some objects printed on the game.
- **Game Over** - After you die there will be a message on the screen saying that you've died and if you want to restart playing.
- **Lives and score** - On the lower portion of the game will have the amount of lives remaining and how many biscuits you have caught.
- **Sounds and music** - There will be background music and each time Jack catches anything a sound will be played.

## Code Smells and Possible Refactorings
### Large Class

Our classes Game and Map contain many fields and methods.
In both cases, we find it justifiable as the classes require these fields,
in one hand the Game class is the main class of the program and it needs to store a considerable amount of data,
on the other hand various methods are needed for the interface and it wouldn't make sense to split it into two separate ones (extract method).
